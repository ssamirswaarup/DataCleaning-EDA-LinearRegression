# Medical Cost Personal Insurance Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate individual medical costs based on various personal health factors and demographic information. By analyzing a dataset of insurance information, we explore the relationships between features like age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region, and the corresponding medical charges. The goal is to develop a model that can provide insights into the factors influencing medical expenses and potentially predict future costs.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is the "Medical Cost Personal Insurance Dataset". It contains information about individuals and their medical insurance charges.

### Dataset Exploration

We started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and content.

- Displaying the top rows using `df.head()`: This gives a glimpse of the data, showing the first few entries and the columns present.

- Rest of the analysis is given in attached .ipynb notebook.
